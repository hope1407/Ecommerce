## Description <a name="description"></a>
This project is a backend application that creates and manages an ecommerce database.  It uses categories, products, tags, and product tags to organize the data.  It also allows users to add, post, put, and delete entries from the database.  Because this is only a backend application, functionality is demonstrated using Insomina.  Further development for this program will include a full front end with polished UI/UX.
## Installation Instructions <a name="install"></a>
Install dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize. You must also add your mysql credentials to a newly created .env file.
## Usage Information <a name="usage"></a>
As of now, this application can only run in Insomnia.  After installing all dependencies, the user must create and seed the database.  Once this is done, run "node server.js" command in terminal, and the application will deploy.
